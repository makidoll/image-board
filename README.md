# Image Board

> üñºÔ∏è Upload images and discuss on anonymized boards.

This is so work in progress. If you really want to check out what I'm working on... 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makixx/image-board && cd image-board
npm install
cp debug.example.js debug.js
```

Edit `debug.js` and run: `node dubug.js` then visit: http://127.0.0.1:3000

I hope I can make this into something people can easily use!
