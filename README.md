# Image Board

> üñºÔ∏è Upload images and discuss on anonymized boards.

**This is so work in progress... not actually usable yet!
But if you really want to check out what I've made so far...** 

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/makitsune/image-board && cd image-board
npm install
node debug.js
```
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:3000 and play around with what's inside of `debug.js`.

I hope I can make this into something people can easily use!


If you know how to use Express, then it should be super simple to add to your
web server which might have things like HTTPS and Analystics, etc...
